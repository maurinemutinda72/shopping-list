## **Features**

1. **Add New Items**  
   - Users can input the name of a new item and add it to the shopping list.

2. **Predefined Items**  
   - The application starts with a list of predefined items such as *Cabbage*, *Zucchini*, *Maize Flour*, *Eggs*, and *Rice*.

3. **Delete Items**  
   - Users can delete any item. The deletion requires confirmation to prevent accidental removal.

4. **Mark Items as Purchased**  
   - Users can toggle the status of an item to mark it as "Purchased" or undo it. Purchased items are visually styled differently.

5. **Edit Items**  
   - Users can edit the name of an existing item in the list.

6. **Clear the List**  
   - A "Clear List" button removes all items after double confirmation for safety.

7. **Finalize the List**  
   - A "The List is Now Okay" button allows users to confirm their list. An additional prompt ensures the user is satisfied.

8. **Interactive User Interface**  
   - The interface includes animations, hover effects, and a responsive design optimized for different devices.


## **Technologies Used**

1. **HTML**  
   - Provides the structure for the web application, including buttons, input fields, and a list display.

2. **CSS**  
   - Adds styling to enhance the user interface, including:  
     - Background animations  
     - Hover effects  
     - Responsive design for various screen sizes

3. **JavaScript**  
   - Implements the logic for interactivity, such as:  
     - Adding and deleting items  
     - Editing item names  
     - Confirming actions to prevent accidental changes  
     - Marking items as purchased

## **How It Works**

1. **Adding Items**  
   - Enter a new item name in the input field and click the **Add Item** button. The item will appear in the shopping list.

2. **Managing Items**  
   - **Mark Purchased**: Click the "Mark Purchased" button to toggle the purchased status.  
   - **Edit**: Click "Edit" to modify the item name.  
   - **Delete**: Click "Delete" to remove the item. A confirmation will appear before deletion.  

3. **Clear List**  
   - Click the "Clear List" button to remove all items. The user must confirm twice before clearing.

4. **Finalize the List**  
   - Click the "The List is Now Okay" button to confirm that the list is finalized. A second prompt will ensure the action is intentional.
